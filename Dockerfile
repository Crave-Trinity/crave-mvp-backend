# Dockerfile
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A lightweight Docker image for the CRAVE Trinity Backend.
#
# This Dockerfile uses Python 3.11-slim and installs dependencies in two phases:
# 1. Upgrading pip and installing torch explicitly.
# 2. Installing the remainder of the requirements from requirements.txt.
#
# This two-phase approach ensures that xformers (which requires torch to be pre‚Äêinstalled)
# builds successfully without metadata-generation errors.
